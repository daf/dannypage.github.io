            ## MLS Salary 2016

            Testing out a new toy: Easy blog posts + Javascript! Hopefully this will code and analysis more accessible.

            The data via MLS Players Union, formatted by [Michael Bertin](https://twitter.com/bertinbertin). Here's a few things we can do with it!

            ### 0. Examine Our Data

            We are going to first examine our JSON dataset. We'll `return` the info that was pre-loaded.



            ```javascript; runnable
            return data.mls_salary_2016
            ```

            We should see `Array[555]`. Click on that arrow, and you can dig into each object, which represents an MLS player, his team, name, and salary.

            Let's investigate some numbers for the entire data set.

            ### 1. Average and Median Salary

            Let's start by looking into the guaranteed salary. Each player has a base & gauaranteed salary. Guaranteed includes bonuses and give us a better picture of what compensation players are receiving.

            ```javascript; runnable
            var average = d3.mean(data.mls_salary_2016, function(d) { return d.guaranteed; });
            var avgRounded = Math.round(average * 100) / 100;
            var median = d3.median(data.mls_salary_2016, function(d) { return d.guaranteed; });

            return "Results: \n" +
                "Average Salary: $" + avgRounded + "\n" +
                "Median Salary:  $" + median;
            ```
